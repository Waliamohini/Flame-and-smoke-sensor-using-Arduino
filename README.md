# Flame-and-smoke-sensor-using-Arduino

This is a flame and  smoke detector made with Arduino.
Fire detection systems are essential for ensuring safety in both residential and industrial
settings. This project explores the development of a low-cost, efficient fire detection system
using Arduino, which is capable of sensing fire through infrared (IR) radiation. The system
uses a flame sensor to detect fire, and once detected, an alarm is triggered through a buzzer and
optional LED indicator. The entire process is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, which
processes sensor data and activates alarms when necessary.
